# Clicktix
Clixtix is a site that allows users to open items whether they be orders, issues, tasks, etc... Users of the app can create register accounts. Once the user has an account they can creat an item with a title and description. As users work with the ticket, they can update the title, description, change the status of the item and add individual notes on updates and work performed. The items can be assigned to other users and all tickets can be viewed, edited, searched and filtered by all users. 

Techonology used
On the front end React was used to make a quick interactive page for users.
On the backend I've used Flask and Postrgres to form a restful API. 

Installation
To install clixtix, simply download the repo and within the front end do NPM install on your terminal. 
On the backend, in the terminal activate the env. 
The backend currently uses sqlite for development if changes are required before deploying.
